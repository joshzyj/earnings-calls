## Parse the text files
Use the sloppy example codes along with CEO or CFO aliases to extract different types of data.

- Particularly look for the keyword "fall" or "falling" in the texts 

    Using machine learning techniques, analyze the speech of analysts and chief officers before, during and after resession periods. Just before and during, the chief officers tend to speak about the fall in profits or falling outputs, etc. etc.
